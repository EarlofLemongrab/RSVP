Danger Log

1.	Our connection to server is not secured by https protocol.
2.	We used event_id, owner_id, guest_id, vendor_id etc. in url to pass parameters. This could be resolved by using NoSQL like Mongo DB.
3.	We do not set a minimul password length or enforcing password to contain letters or special characters.
4.	Some exceptions are not handled quite gracefully.
5.	User can input anything in text input. While django has system mechanism against sql injection attack, we do not sanitize user input in our program.
