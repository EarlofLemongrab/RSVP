Deployment Guide

by Tian Liao and Dong Long

1. Modify settings.py. If you want to run this app locally, add "localhost" to allowed_host. If you want to run this app on a virtual machine, be sure to add address of virtual machine to allowed_host.

2. Configure database. We configured with our credentials in development. While django app is highly portable, it still requires you to fill in your database credentials in settings.py. You could create a new user (with password) and a new database name in postgres.

3. Before starting server, please do "python manage.py makemigrations" and "python manage.py migrate" to ensure database is migrated.

4. Start server by "python manage.py runserver".

7. If you are running locally, go to "localhost:8000/rsvp/"
